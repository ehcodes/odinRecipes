# Odin Recipes
In this Odin Project Project, the objective is to create a simple HTML only recipes website. If you'd like to see the instructions I followed to complete this repo, please visit [this link to The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes). 

## Skills Learned
- The importance of using semantic HTML.
- Proper usage of the following elements and the use of attributes.
  - `<html></html>`: HTML - This is the root element. All of the html elements will be children of this element. The browser will expect anything between the opening and closing `html` tags to be HTML.
  - `<head></head>`: Head - This element contains all data intended for the web browser. The data contained within these tags are meant to inform the browser and not for the user to actually see.
  - `<meta></meta>`: Meta - This element provides the browser with information such as which characters to expect (`charset`), or how to behave on a small screen (`viewport`).
  - `<title></title>`: Title - This element provides the browser with a title or name for the web page.
  - `<body></body>`: Body - This element houses all of the information that will be viewable to the user. 
  - `<a></a>`: Anchor - This element is used to create a link on the webpage. The `href` attribute  is used to identify the source of the link. The `title` attribute provides context for the link.
  - `<img>`: Image - Adds an image to the web page. The `src` attribute  is used to identify the source of the image. And the `alt` attribute is used to provide a description of the image for screen readers.
  - `<ol></ol>`: Ordered List - Adds an ordered (numbered) list to the web page. The `<li>List Item</li>` tag is used to add child elements to the ordered list.
  - `<ul></ul>`: Unordered List - Adds an unordered list to the web page. The `<li>List Item</li>` tag is also used by this element in the same way it is used in an ordered list.
  - `<h1></h1>`: Heading 1 - This element is used to denote that it is the most important heading on the web page. There are 5 levels of headings available (`h1 , h2, h3, h4, h5`), While `h1` indicates the utmost importance, `h5` indicates the least importance.
  - `<p></p>`: Paragraph - this element is used to add a paragraph to a webpage.
