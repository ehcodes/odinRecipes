        </li>
        <li>
          Pureé the chopped vegetables until it's uniform, feeling as though it has grains of sand in it. This may take between 5-10 minutes. Make sure there are no clumps in the pureé.

        </li>
        <li>
          Once the pasteles are ready, turn off the stove and carefully remove the water from the pot.
